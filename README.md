Working with cookies is crucial in web testing. 
Cookies are small files stored by the browser that hold data about the user's interactions with websites.
They are used to remember user preferences, login information, and other details for sites visited frequently. 
Testing cookies ensures that web applications handle user data correctly and maintain the expected behavior across sessions. 
Selenium provides a comprehensive set of classes and methods specifically designed for handling cookies. 
These tools allow testers to create, retrieve, update, and delete cookies, enabling thorough validation of cookie-related functionality in web applications.
